# Middleware

Caliban allows you to perform additional actions at various levels of a query processing, via the concept of `Wrapper`. Using wrappers, you can:
- verify that a query doesn't reach some limit (e.g. depth, complexity)
- modify a query before it's executed
- add timeouts to queries or fields
- log each field execution time
- support [Apollo Tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing), [Apollo Caching](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/caching) or anything similar
- etc.

## Wrapper types

There are 6 basic types of wrappers:
 - `OverallWrapper` to wrap the whole query processing
 - `ParsingWrapper` to wrap the query parsing only
 - `ValidationWrapper` to wrap the query validation only
 - `ExecutionWrapper` to wrap the query execution only
 - `FieldWrapper` to wrap each field execution
 - `IntrospectionWrapper` to wrap the introspection query only

Each one requires a function that takes a `ZIO` or `ZQuery` computation together with some contextual information (e.g. the query string) and should return another computation.

Let's see how to implement a wrapper that times out the whole query if its processing takes longer than 1 minute.

```scala mdoc:silent
import caliban._
import caliban.CalibanError._
import caliban.Value._
import caliban.wrappers.Wrapper._
import zio._

val wrapper = new OverallWrapper[Any] {
  def wrap[R](
    process: GraphQLRequest => ZIO[R, Nothing, GraphQLResponse[CalibanError]]
  ): GraphQLRequest => ZIO[R, Nothing, GraphQLResponse[CalibanError]] =
    (request: GraphQLRequest) =>
      process(request)
        .timeout(1.minute)
        .map(
          _.getOrElse(
            GraphQLResponse(
              NullValue,
              List(ExecutionError(s"Query was interrupted after 1 minute:\n${request.query}"))
            )
          )
        )
}
```

You can also combine wrappers using `|+|` and create a wrapper that requires an effect to be run at each query using `EffectfulWrapper`.

To use your wrapper, call `GraphQL#withWrapper` or its alias `@@`.
```scala
val api = graphQL(...).withWrapper(wrapper)
// or
val api = graphQL(...) @@ wrapper
```

## Pre-defined wrappers


Caliban comes with a few pre-made wrappers in `caliban.wrappers.Wrappers`:
- `maxDepth` returns a wrapper that fails queries whose depth is higher than a given value
- `maxFields` returns a wrapper that fails queries whose number of fields is higher than a given value
- `maxCost` returns a wrapper that fails queries when the estimated cost of execution exceeds a given value
- `queryCost` returns a wrapper which adds an extension field that includes the cost of executing the query
- `timeout` returns a wrapper that fails queries taking more than a specified time
- `printErrors` returns a wrapper that prints errors
- `printSlowQueries` returns a wrapper that prints slow queries
- `logSlowQueries` returns a wrapper that logs slow queries via ZIO's built-in logging
- `onSlowQueries` returns a wrapper that can run a given function on slow queries
- `metrics` returns a wrapper that adds field-level metrics (count & duration) to the schema

In addition to those, Caliban also ships with some non-spec but standard wrappers
- `caliban.wrappers.ApolloTracing.apolloTracing` returns a wrapper that adds tracing data into the `extensions` field of each response following [Apollo Tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing) format.
- `caliban.wrappers.Caching.extension` returns a wrapper that computes the total cache policy for a query and stores it in the extensions of the response.  The result can then be used by http adapters to set the appropriate cache headers in the response.
- `caliban.wrappers.ApolloPersistedQueries.apolloPersistedQueries` returns a wrapper that caches and retrieves query using a hash using the [Apollo Persisted Queries](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-persisted-queries) format.

They can be used like this:
```scala
val api =
  graphQL(...) @@
    maxDepth(50) @@
    timeout(3 seconds) @@
    printSlowQueries(500 millis) @@
    apolloTracing() @@
    Caching.extension()
```

## Wrapping the interpreter

All the wrappers mentioned above require that you don't modify the environment `R` and the error type which is always a `CalibanError`. It is also possible to wrap your `GraphQLInterpreter` by calling `wrapExecutionWith` on it. This method takes in a function `f` and returns a new `GraphQLInterpreter` that will wrap the `execute` method with this function `f`.

It is used internally to implement `mapError` (customize errors) and `provide` (eliminate the environment), but you can use it for other purposes such as adding a general timeout, logging response times, etc.

```scala
val i: GraphQLInterpreter[MyEnv, CalibanError] = ???

// change error type to String
val i2: GraphQLInterpreter[MyEnv, String] = i.mapError(_.toString)

// provide the environment
val i3: GraphQLInterpreter[Any, CalibanError] = i.provide(myEnv)

// add a timeout on every query execution
val i4: GraphQLInterpreter[MyEnv, CalibanError] =
  i.wrapExecutionWith(
    _.timeout(30 seconds).map(
      _.getOrElse(GraphQLResponse(NullValue, List(ExecutionError("Timeout!"))))
    )
  )
```

## Customizing error responses

During various phases of executing a query, an error may occur. Caliban renders the different instances of `CalibanError` to a GraphQL spec compliant response. As a user, you will most likely encounter `ExecutionError` at some point because this will encapsulate the errors in the error channel of your effects. For Caliban to be able to render some basic message about the error that occured during query execution, it is important that your error extends `Throwable`.

For more meaningful error handling, GraphQL spec allows for an [`extension`](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#example-fce18) object in the error response. This object may include, for instance, `code` information to model enum-like error codes that can be handled by a front-end. In order to generate this information, one can use the `mapError` function on a `GraphQLInterpreter`. An example is provided below in which we map a custom domain error within an `ExecutionError` to a meaningful error code.

```scala mdoc:silent
import caliban.ResponseValue.ObjectValue

sealed trait ExampleAppEncodableError extends Throwable {
    def errorCode: String
}
case object UnauthorizedError extends ExampleAppEncodableError {
    override def errorCode: String = "UNAUTHORIZED"
}

def withErrorCodeExtensions[R](
  interpreter: GraphQLInterpreter[R, CalibanError]
): GraphQLInterpreter[R, CalibanError] = interpreter.mapError {
  case err @ ExecutionError(_, _, _, Some(exampleError: ExampleAppEncodableError), _) =>
    err.copy(extensions = Some(ObjectValue(List(("errorCode", StringValue(exampleError.errorCode))))))
  case err: ExecutionError =>
    err.copy(extensions = Some(ObjectValue(List(("errorCode", StringValue("EXECUTION_ERROR"))))))
  case err: ValidationError =>
    err.copy(extensions = Some(ObjectValue(List(("errorCode", StringValue("VALIDATION_ERROR"))))))
  case err: ParsingError =>
    err.copy(extensions = Some(ObjectValue(List(("errorCode", StringValue("PARSING_ERROR"))))))
}
```

## Wrapping the GraphQL

If you need to implement new functionality that involves not just changes to execution but also to the underlying
schema you can use the higher-level `GraphQLAspect` which allows full control of the resulting `GraphQL` that it wraps.

Here is such an example that is part of the `federation` package which makes a schema available to be used as a sub-graph in
a federated graph:

```scala
  def federate[R](original: GraphQL[R]): GraphQL[R] = {
    import Schema._

    case class Query(
      _service: _Service,
      _fieldSet: FieldSet = FieldSet("")
    )

    graphQL(RootResolver(Query(_service = _Service(original.render))), federationDirectives) |+| original
  }

  lazy val federated: GraphQLAspect[Nothing, Any] = 
    new GraphQLAspect[Nothing, Any] {
      def apply[R1](original: GraphQL[R1]): GraphQL[R1] =
        federate(original)
    }
```

## Cost Estimation

The `queryCost` and `maxCost` wrappers as well as their variants can be used to estimate the cost of a query, however they require a bit 
more set up to work properly.

These wrappers are in the `CostEstimation` object which also comes with a special directive that can be used out of the box to instrument your
schema for cost analysis.

Given a schema in which different fields have different costs to execute, either because they require additional network or computing resources, or database access, or they 
have some other dependency that makes them expensive to compute. You can add the `CostDirective` to your resolver like so:

```scala mdoc:silent
import caliban.schema.Schema.auto._
import caliban.schema.ArgBuilder.auto._
import caliban.wrappers.CostEstimation
import caliban.wrappers.CostEstimation._

case class SpokenLineArgs(offset: Int, limit: Int)

@GQLCost(2)
case class Character(
  name: String,
  // Compute a realtime list of all the spoken lines for this character
  @GQLCost(100, multipliers = List("limit"))
  spokenLines: SpokenLineArgs => UIO[List[String]]
)

case class Query(
  @GQLCost(5) characters: UIO[List[Character]],
)

def allCharacterNames: UIO[List[String]] = ZIO.succeed(???)
def getLines(name: String, offset: Int, limit: Int): UIO[List[String]] = ???

val api = graphQL(RootResolver(Query(
  characters = allCharacterNames.flatMap { 
    names => ZIO.foreach(names) { name =>
      val character = Character(
        name,
        spokenLines = args => getLines(name, args.offset, args.limit)
      )
      ZIO.succeed(character)
    } 
  }
)))

val apiWithCost = api @@ 
  queryCost @@ // or queryCost(f: Field => Double) to specify your own field cost estimation
  // or queryCostWith(f: Field => Double)(p: Double => URIO[R, Any]) to also specify a side effect after computing the total cost
  // or queryCostZIO(f: Field => URIO[R, Double]) if your field calculation returns an effect
  maxCost(100)(CostEstimation.costDirective)
  // or maxCostOrError(maxCost)(f: Double => ValidationError) to specify a different error
  // or maxCostZIO(maxCost)(f: Field => URIO[R, Double]) if your field calculation returns an effect

```

In the above example we have provided a couple different examples. For instance, we can add the directive to both types and 
to fields. In this case the field resolver will override the type cost, however if there is no field cost then the type cost will be used.
We may also specify a "multipliers" argument when using arguments. This will match the argument names and use numeric argument values to multiply the base value.
In the above case this means that a query that specifies a `limit` of `10` for the `spokenLines` field will have the base field cost multipled by 10 resulting in a total cost
of execution of `1000`

## OpenTelemetry Tracing

Caliban ships with support for OpenTelemetry tracing via integration with [zio-telemetry](https://github.com/zio/zio-telemetry) in the `caliban-tracing` package.

In order to use tracing, first add `caliban-tracing` to your `built.sbt`.

```scala
"com.github.ghostdogpr" %% "caliban-tracing" % "2.5.3"
```

Then add it to your schema as any other wrapper:

```scala
import caliban.tracing.TracingWrapper
import zio.telemetry.opentelemetry.Tracing

val api: GraphQL[Any] = ???
val tracedApi = api @@ TracingWrapper.traced
```

This will now make sure that any effect (ZIO or ZQuery) is measured as its own span, which makes it easy to spot potential optimizations (such as sequential loading) in your schema.

More or less like this:

```
query         |----------------------------------------------|
field a         |-------|
field b                  |-------|
nested field                      |-----------------------|
nested field a                      |-------------------|
nested field b                      |-------------------|
```

which makes it easy to spot that e.g field a and field b could be resolved in parallel.
