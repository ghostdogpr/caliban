# Schemas

A GraphQL schema will be derived automatically at compile-time (no reflection) from the types present in your resolver.
The table below shows how common Scala types are converted to GraphQL types.

| Scala Type                                          | GraphQL Type                                                     |

::: warning Schema derivation issues
Magnolia (the library used to derive the schema at compile-time) sometimes has some trouble generating schemas with a lot of nested types, or types reused in multiple places.
To deal with this, you can declare schemas for your case classes and sealed traits explicitly:

```scala
implicit val roleSchema      = Schema.gen[Role]
implicit val characterSchema = Schema.gen[Character]
```

Make sure those implicits are in scope when you call `graphQL(...)`. This will make Magnolia's job easier by pre-generating schemas for those classes and re-using them when needed.
This will also improve compilation times and generate less bytecode.

If the derivation fails and you're not sure why, you can also call Magnolia's macro directly by using `genMacro`.
The compilation will return better error messages in case something is missing:

```scala
implicit val characterSchema = Schema.genMacro[Character].schema
```
:::

## Enums, unions, interfaces

A sealed trait will be converted to a different GraphQL type depending on its content:

- a sealed trait with only case objects will be converted to an `ENUM`
- a sealed trait with only case classes will be converted to a `UNION`

GraphQL does not support empty objects, so in case a sealed trait mixes case classes and case objects, a union type will be created and the case objects will have a "fake" field named `_` which is not queryable.

```scala
sealed trait ORIGIN
object ORIGIN {
  case object EARTH extends ORIGIN
  case object MARS  extends ORIGIN
  case object BELT  extends ORIGIN
}
```

The snippet above will produce the following GraphQL type:

```graphql
enum Origin {
  BELT
  EARTH
  MARS
}
```

Here's an example of union:

```scala
sealed trait Role
object Role {
  case class Captain(shipName: String) extends Role
  case class Engineer(specialty: String) extends Role
  case object Mechanic extends Role
}
```

The snippet above will produce the following GraphQL type:

```graphql
union Role = Captain | Engineer | Mechanic

type Captain {
  shipName: String!
}

type Engineer {
  specialty: String!
}

type Mechanic {
  _: Boolean!
}
```

If you prefer an `Interface` instead of a `Union` type, add the `@GQLInterface` annotation to your sealed trait.
An interface will be created with all the fields that are common to the case classes extending the sealed trait, as long as they return the same type.

## Arguments

To declare a field that take arguments, create a dedicated case class representing the arguments and make the field a _function_ from this class to the result type.

```scala
case class FilterArgs(origin: Option[Origin])
case class Queries(characters: FilterArgs => List[Character])
```

The snippet above will produce the following GraphQL type:

```graphql
type Queries {
  characters(origin: Origin): [Character!]!
}
```

Caliban provides auto-derivation for common types such as `Int`, `String`, `List`, `Option`, etc. but you can also support your own types by providing an implicit instance of `caliban.schema.ArgBuilder`.

::: tip
There is no `ArgBuilder` for tuples. If you have multiple arguments, use a case class containing all of them instead of a tuple.
:::

## Effects

Fields can return ZIO effects. This allows you to leverage all the features provided by ZIO: timeouts, retries, access to ZIO environment, memoizing, etc. An effect will be run every time a query requiring the corresponding field is executed.

```scala
case class Queries(characters: Task[List[Character]],
                   character: CharacterName => RIO[Console, Character])
```

If you don't use ZIO environment (`R` = `Any`), there is nothing special to do to get it working.

If you require a ZIO environment, you will need to have the content of `caliban.schema.GenericSchema[R]` for your custom `R` in scope when you call `graphQL(...)`.

```scala
object schema extends GenericSchema[MyEnv]
import schema._
```

## Annotations

Caliban supports a few annotations to enrich data types:

- `@GQLName("name")` allows you to specify a different name for a data type or a field.
- `@GQLInputName("name")` allows you to specify a different name for a data type used as an input (by default, the suffix `Input` is appended to the type name).
- `@GQLDescription("description")` lets you provide a description for a data type or field. This description will be visible when your schema is introspected.
- `@GQLDeprecated("reason")` allows deprecating a field or an enum value.
- `@GQLInterface` to force a sealed trait generating an interface instead of a union.
- `@GQLDirective(directive: Directive)` to add a directive to a field or type.

## Java 8 Time types

Caliban provides implicit `Schema` types for the standard `java.time` types, by default these will use the
ISO standard strings for serialization and deserialization. However, you can customize this behavior by using
explicit constructor available under the `ArgBuilder` companion object. For instance, you can specify an `instantEpoch` 
to handle instants which are encoded using a `Long` from the standard java epoch time (January 1st 1970 00:00:00).
For some time formats you can also specify a specific `DateTimeFormatter` to handle your particular date time needs. 

## Custom types

Caliban provides auto-derivation for common types such as `Int`, `String`, `List`, `Option`, etc. but you can also support your own types by providing an implicit instance of `caliban.schema.Schema`.

An easy way to do this is to reuse existing instances and use `contramap` to map from your type to the original type. Here's an example of creating an instance for [refined](https://github.com/fthomas/refined)'s `NonEmptyString` reusing existing instance for `String` (if you use `refined`, you might want to look at [caliban-refined](https://github.com/niqdev/caliban-extras#caliban-refined))):

```scala
import caliban.schema._
implicit val nonEmptyStringSchema: Schema[Any, NonEmptyString] = Schema.stringSchema.contramap(_.value)
```

You can also use the `scalarSchema` helper to create your own scalar types, providing a name, an optional description, and a function from your type to a `ResponseValue`:

```scala
import caliban.schema._
implicit val unitSchema: Schema[Any, Unit] = scalarSchema("Unit", None, _ => ObjectValue(Nil))
```

If you are using a custom type as part of the input you also have to provide an implicit instance of `caliban.schema.ArgBuilder`. For example here's how to do that for `java.time.LocalDate`:

```scala
implicit val localDateArgBuilder: ArgBuilder[LocalDate] = {
  case StringValue(value) =>
    Try(LocalDate.parse(value))
      .fold(ex => Left(ExecutionError(s"Can't parse $value into a LocalDate", innerThrowable = Some(ex))), Right(_))
  case other => Left(ExecutionError(s"Can't build a LocalDate from input $other"))
}
```

Value classes (`case class SomeWrapper(self: SomeType) extends AnyVal`) will be unwrapped by default.

## Code generation

Caliban can automatically generate Scala code from a GraphQL schema.

In order to use this feature, add the `caliban-codegen-sbt` sbt plugin to your `project/plugins.sbt` file:
```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.github.ghostdogpr" % "caliban-codegen-sbt" % "0.9.4")
```

And enable it in your `build.sbt` file:
```scala
enablePlugins(CodegenPlugin)
```

Then call the `calibanGenSchema` sbt command.
```scala
calibanGenSchema schemaPath outputPath [--scalafmtPath path] [--headers name:value,name2:value2] [--packageName name] [--effect fqdn.Effect]

calibanGenSchema project/schema.graphql src/main/MyAPI.scala
```
This command will create a Scala file in `outputPath` containing all the types defined in the provided GraphQL schema defined at `schemaPath`. Instead of a file, you can provide a URL and the schema will be obtained using introspection.

The generated code will be formatted with Scalafmt using the configuration defined by `--scalafmtPath` option (default: `.scalafmt.conf`). If you provide a URL for `schemaPath`, you can provide request headers with `--headers` option.

The package of the generated code is derived from the folder of `outputPath`. This can be overridden by providing an alternative package with the `--packageName` option.

By default, each Query and Mutation will be wrapped into a `zio.UIO` effect. This can be overridden by providing an alternative effect with the `--effect` option.

## Building Schemas by hand

Sometimes for whatever reason schema generation fails. This can happen if your schema has co-recursive types and Magnolia is unable
to generate a schema for them. In cases like these you may need to instead create your own schema by hand.

Consider the case where you have three types which create cyclical dependencies on one another

```scala
case class Group(id: String, users: UIO[List[User]], parent: UIO[Option[Group]], organization: UIO[Organization])
case class Organization(id: String, groups: UIO[List[Group]])
case class User(id: String, group: UIO[Group])
```

These three types all depend on one another and if you attempt to generate a schema from them you will either end up with compiler errors or you will end up with a nasty runtime
error from a `NullPointerException`. To help the compiler out we can hand generate the types for these case classes instead.

```scala
import caliban.schema.Schema.{obj, field}

implicit lazy val groupSchema: Schema[Any, Group] = obj("Group", Some("A group of users"))(
  implicit ft =>
    List(
      field("id")(_.id),
      field("users")(_.users),
      field("parent")(_.parent),
      field("organization")(_.organization)
    )
)
implicit lazy val orgSchema: Schema[Any, Organization] = obj("Organization", Some("An organization of groups"))(
  implicit ft =>
    List(
      field("id")(_.id),
      field("groups")(_.groups)
    )
)

implicit lazy val userSchema: Schema[Any, User] = obj("User", Some("A user of the service"))(
  implicit ft =>
    List(
      field("id")(_.id),
      field("group")(_.group)
    )
)
```
